## Project: Monster Shop

### Group Members: Tylor Schafer, Evette Telyas, Fenton Taylor

### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

  - Everyone on the team wants to know how each piece of the project functions. We all agree that spliting up the work is the best way to approach a project of this size, but want to assure that every member knows how everything works. We know we are successfull when we have completed all functionality and can explain every piece individually.

### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

  - Tylor: Testing, RESTful conventions, model behaviors.
  - Fenton: Database Queries, Testing.
  - Evette: Emojis
  - All group members can collaborate as a group or get work individually.

### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

   - We are all capable of getting work done individually. However we have a good support system to help each other when getting stuck on certain features.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):

  - No staying late, 5pm cutoff time. Fenton will not be available over the weekend. Everyone likes to get work done at home, we agree to stay available on Slack in case any member needs help.

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):

  - We will do mini retro EOD erry day. We should always know what we should be working on for that day.

### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

  - Tylor: Would like to improve on raw SQL queries and active record.
  - Evette: Testing
  - Fenton: Authentication and Autorization

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

  - Evenly divide features of project.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

  - Must use project board, never merge your own pull requests. All features should merged through branches.

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

  - Positive and contructive, be specific so feedback is actionable.

### Project management tools we will use:

  - github projects, slack
